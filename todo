#DONE#reply: Sidha to uthaya hai, but in home page backgroud image is black, so it is looking good. there background image is also white, as border is also white, so it is not looking good. tell him to change php/views/locsearch.php file [ Look at line 9, which is dependend on variable $page, which is "index" for home page & book for booking page. So make changes according to it. ]
